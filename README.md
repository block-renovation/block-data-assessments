## Postscript Analyst and Data Engineering Take-Home Assignments

Thanks for your application to Postscript! This homework is intended to mimic the type of work you may be expected to complete as a part of the team as either an Analyst or a Data Engineer. 

This project includes hard deliverables and open-ended responses. We suggest you approach your solution(s) with the same mindset we use in our day-to-day - by applying our [core values](https://www.postscript.io/about-us/). This is intended to give us a handle on how you come up with solutions and design something that will solve the issue at hand. 

If you are unable to complete the assignment, that is completely OK. Be sure to annotate your work or write up a small segment on what remains to be implemented and how you would go about wrapping things up. Be sure to consult your role-specific instructions for more information.

**Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this homework.**
